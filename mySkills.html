        <div id="Communication" class="Communication">
            <br>
            <h6>Communication Skills:</h6>
            <br> I am an excellent communicator with a talent for conveying information clearly and concisely. I am confident in both written and verbal
            communication in two languages. I can tailor my communication style to the audience I am speaking to.
            <br>This is my second experience studying in a foreign country, demonstrating my capacity to communicate successfully in academic
            language. I previously attended an American High School for a year before studying at a university in Ireland. 
            <br> I also have to demonstrate my communication skills in my line of work by speaking appropriately
            when I answer the restaurant phone. I handle reservations, cancellations, and client inquiries.
        </div>

        <div id="Teamwork" class="Teamwork">
            <br> 
            <h6> Teamwork Skills:</h6>
            <br>I am a cooperative team player who appreciates open communication. I am aware of the value of compromise, active listening, and helping my
            teammates reach shared objectives.
            <br>Working on a conveyer belt at Mercedes Benz AG, I had to prove my competence as a team player. I had to coordinate my work
            with everyone else on my conveyer belt in order to assemble the car components before the car moved to the next belt.
            <br>Furthermore, I am a part of a small group of waitresses, chefs, and event managers. Everyone must collaborate closely and fluidly,
            rotating between various tasks as needed to provide assistance. This can only succeed if everyone works smoothly with each other and is
            aware of others around them.
        </div>

        <div id="Problem" class="Problem">
            <br> 
            <h6>Problem Solving & Analytics Skills:</h6>
            <br> I have strong problem-solving skills and can solve complex problems creatively and practically.
            <br> I have to demonstrate this every day as I pursue my degree. In my module, CS4052 - Foundations of Interaction Design, I am
            given problems that I must address within a certain time frame and present to my lecturer and classmates. My most recent assignment
            involved the problem of working from home and the impending lack of socialising. My group and I created a low-fidelity prototype for an
            app that allows colleagues to communicate via brief interfaces or texts without switching windows.
            <br> Moreover, I have experience working in fast-paced and challenging environments where quick and accurate decision-making is crucial.
            The problem of being unable to pay out employees at the end of the night existed at my most recent job. I devised a plan to replenish the
            missing funds with cash from a different register and changed the cash register form for that particular day. I could fill the cash register
            with enough cash to pay every employee and cover the expenses for the following day.
        </div>

        <div id="Initiative" class="Initiative">
            <br>  
            <h6>Using Initiative:</h6>
            <br> I am a self-starter who is unafraid to take the initiative and lead projects and tasks. I can identify opportunities for improvement and
            actively seek ways to make a positive impact.
            <br> I completed a project in a group of four for my module SO4033, Sociology of Media, on the topic of Homelessness in Ireland. Even
            though I was not assigned the team leader role, I quickly took over because the initial team leader was overwhelmed by the
            responsibilities and workload. 
            <br> My responsibilities included ensuring everyone knew what to do, encouraging team participants to complete their share of the project, and guaranteeing an on-time submission.
        </div>

        <div id="Projects" class="Projects">
            <br> 
            <h6> Projects/Portfolio/Volunteering:</h6>
            <br> Outside of my university education, I am taking a beginners Irish Language and Culture course to further my knowledge.
            <br> Currently, I am a member of two committees. I operate as the assistant public relations officer for the Feminist Society and as one of the
            first-year representatives for the Equestrian Club. In addition, I am one of my class's two representatives and a member of the Literary Society.
            <br> Below is the link to my LinkedIn profile for further information.

        <div id="Additional" class="Additional">
            <br> 
            <h6> Additional: </h6>
            <br> I enjoy utilising interactive programming, developing prototypes, and using artistic tools to create screen-based content. 
            <br> I have a strong academic background and am committed to using my abilities to make a positive difference in the world, tackling new challenges and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Furthermore, I was a Leaving Certification math tutor during my GAP year.
            <br> I received a letter from the president of the University of Limerick in recognition of my outstanding academic achievement for the Autumn Semester of 2022/23.
            <br> In addition to this, I received a varsity letter from De Soto High School in May 2019 and was on the Honor Roll for the academic year 2018/19.
